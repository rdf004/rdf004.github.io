The large images allow for quick and easy identification of groups and adds color to the page, making it more aesthetic. However, users may find it unintuitive because the layout varies from LinkedIn\u2019s traditional row organization, which users will recognize from their list of connections for example. From future testing, we hope to understand whether users understand tile layouts not present in the original app. In addition, we hope to establish whether they value visual cues over verbal descriptions and whether the graphic layout detracts from the LinkedIn app\u2019s \u201cprofessional\u201d ambience."),r.a.createElement("h3",null,"Alternate Events List Designs"),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"alt-div"},r.a.createElement("img",{className:"alt",src:z.a,alt:"Design Iteration 1"}),r.a.createElement("img",{className:"alt",src:B.a,alt:"Design Iteration 1"})),r.a.createElement("p",null,"We also created an alternate version of the screen showing events.

The success of this version also depends on whether the event creators upload quality pictures. If users recognize events from the image, events may have better recognition on news feeds.

Further questions revealed the navigation was difficult for two reasons. First, the user wasn\u2019t being led to the screens they were expecting to be led to after certain actions.

They searched for obvious icons to create the new group view the new group. While the other feedback was useful, many problems stemmed from difficulty navigating the feature. For this reason, we decided to focus on the screens that facilitate the two main experiences. The first was the screen to initialize the group. The second was the screen transitioning from creating the group to the new group. Our TAs expressed similar thoughts, and stated that they did not fully grasp how the screens fit together.
