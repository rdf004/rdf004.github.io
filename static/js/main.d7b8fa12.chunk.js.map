I wanted to help build out their music instrument program, but needed credibility to fundraise. So, I went to the library and found a Nolo’s do-it-yourself law book on how to start nonprofits. I started a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Jazz Helping Hands and was able to kickstart a great piano program at the Boys & Girls Club. We also started a music program at an orphanage in Tanzania, Africa.<br/><br/>\n                From Jazz Helping Hands, I fell in love with business, product strategy, and executing visions with extremely limited resources.<br/><br/>\n                When I came to college, I found a great group of friends (Ian, Cyrus, and Surya) during Week 0 and we competed in hackathons together. We placed at SD Hacks and SB Hacks and won at Design 4 San Diego and HackTech, Caltech’s premier hackathon.<br/><br/>\n                After my freshman year, I interned at Goldman Sachs. Besides some finance work, I built a few enterprise applications for my team. One automated updating our client list by integrating with existing applications, and another used a Bayesian Classifier to automatically assign clients and investment reports to the best-fit member on our team. Together, they save the team about 35 hours per month.<br/><br/>\n                I loved Goldman, but I missed the product strategy and analysis from running Jazz Helping Hands, so I sought more product  positions. So, this past summer, I interned as a PM at Microsoft on the Azure enterprise security team, where I helped launch a new policy-driven remote attestation service for Microsoft SQL Server and helped design a new service for Windows developers to port legacy Win32 applications onto a sandbox, so compromised apps can’t access the whole OS. I received an offer from PlayFab (acq. by Microsoft in Jan. 2018) and will likely go back. I'm pretty sure James Gwertzman will be my skip manager, so pretty sweet gig.<br/><br/>\n                Now, I’m looking for product roles and software engineering roles at startups.

Hence, I created an app and an IoT device that essentially uses a collection of weak networks as as single strong network. People in a community can vote for movies/videos they want to see, and the top-voted videos will be split and a single segment will be downloaded onto each of their IoT devices. The video is then combined locally (not using the Internet) so that each person has a copy of the video. BitFlix is on GitHub <a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://github.com/rdf004/Bitflix\">here</a>.<br/><br/>\n\n                    <b>(2018) Ark</b> - At HackTech 2018, my team created an AI chatbot to help students read research papers. As students read a research paper, if they had a question about the paper or about the topic, they could ask Ark, our chatbot. Ark used AllenAI to parse the research paper and Wikipedia for answers to their question. Ark won at HackTech 2018, and you can see it <a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://devpost.com/software/ark-s8t51q\">here</a>.

We scraped Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter for posts and tweets about movies and used sentiment analysis and natural language processing to generate five-star ratings as well as categorize the most positive and negative reviews, all on a beautiful ReactJS frontend. SentAI received honorable mentions at SB Hacks. SentAI is on GitHub \n                    &nbsp;<a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://github.com/IanCarrasco/SentAI\">here</a>.

I used machine learning techniques to predict whether the stock prices of big-box companies would increase or decrease over a variety of time series. It was an amateur project, but was published in a journal for outstanding high school research.

Founded in 2002, LinkedIn has transformed into the premier social media site for professional networking, brand building, and job hunting.</p>\n                    <p>LinkedIn recently launched an events feature which allows users to create events and advertise them on their news feeds, similar to Facebook events. However, the LinkedIn Events feature has struggled to gain traction, partially because the current feature fails to tie into LinkedIn’s mission of “connecting the world’s professionals”. Hence, my team and I decided to redesign the LinkedIn events feature in order to drive more interpersonal interaction and networking between professionals. To do this, we narrowed our scope to professionals at networking events and conferences because they provide prime opportunities for professionals to meet new connections.</p>\n                    <p>My teammates Edward and Prabhav and I collaborated on all work. Each of us had a hand in design, user interviews, and writing. However, I focused more on writing and on the Figma LinkedIn app high-fidelity prototypes. I was also responsible for all paper prototypes and summarizing design testing feedback.</p>\n                    <h2>The Problem</h2>\n                    <p className=\"case-important\" ><b><b>LinkedIn users at professional conferences and networking events should be able to rekindle old connections, strengthen existing connections, and discover new connections from other attendees.</b></b></p>\n                    <p></p>\n                    <h3>Target User</h3>\n                    <p>We’ve decided to focus on attendees of <b>professional conferences</b>, <b>networking events</b>, and <b>recruiting events</b> as our target audience.</p>\n                    <h3>User Goals</h3>\n                    <p>Users (event attendees) should be able to:</p>\n                    - check-in as attending a certain professional conference or networking event<br/>\n                    - find out which connections or friends are also attending<br/>\n                    - engage with and set up in-person meetings and hangouts at the event\n                    <h3>Why This Idea?</h3>\n                    <p>LinkedIn’s mission is simple enough: connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful. A feature like this would spearhead new opportunities for users to grow their network, and even reignite old connections in the offline, real world. </p>\n                    <p>Imagine that you’re attending a professional conference like Grace Hopper, and you find out that Erika, your roommate freshman year, and Jess, your office-mate from your first job out of college, are also attending. You haven’t seen them in years, so naturally, you want to meet up with them and make the most of this event, together.\nWe’re empowering users to do just that. Introducing, Events Check-In: a new LinkedIn feature to bring you closer to your connections during shared experiences, such as professional conferences and networking events.</p>\n                    <p>Through LinkedIn, attendees of an event can check into the event, and discover other people, including their connections, who are also attending the event. This helps attendees in a few ways:</p>\n                    <p>- Empower them to engage with friends and connections, thus rekindling old bonds and enforcing existing ones through shared experience<br/>\n                    - Interact with new people at the event. Discover and make new connections with similar goals for the event, thus further enriching the event experience.<br/>\n                    - Those listing as attending are verified. There’s no awkward guesswork of who’s actually coming, like with Facebook events.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Our feature would help attendees prepare meetings before the event even starts, and enhance the experience during the event. LinkedIn currently has messaging and Bluetooth connect features, and we plan to leverage them to help attendees make group chats and share questions, concerns, and plans for the event.</p>\n                    <h2>Interviews</h2>\n                    <p>We conducted two one-on-one interviews. The first was with Faby Zuñiga, a university recruiter at Microsoft, who attends several conferences per year as a recruiter representing Microsoft. The second was with Jennifer Zheng, a software engineer at LinkedIn who also attends several conferences per year, both to represent LinkedIn and to learn more about the technology industry community.</p>\n                    <img className=\"big-img\" src={interviewees} alt=\"interviewees\" />\n                    <img className=\"big-img\" src={cpp} alt=\"findings\" />\n                    <h2>User Flows and Paper Prototypes</h2>\n                    <img className=\"big-img\" src={flow1} alt=\"flow1\" />\n                    <img className=\"big-img\" src={flow2} alt=\"flow2\" />\n                    <p>Our goal is to extend the extend the LinkedIn Events feature in a way that encourages in-person interaction at conferences and professional events. To achieve this goal, people must know who is attending the event and interact with them. After designing our User Workflows, we decided to center our functionality to specifically the features that would encourage interaction in real life. Therefore, we took the idea of verified and unverified check-ins from the original user goals, because people can only physically meet up with others who are actually at the event. We also took the design idea of listing all attendees, and offering a way to connect or interact with them from the list of all attendees.</p>\n                    <p>To explore and test our initial workflows, we designed <b>Flow A</b>, which focuses on groups that the attendee or recruiter can create, and the flow from viewing a conference or event to creating a group.</p>\n                    <img className=\"big-img\" src={flowa} alt=\"flowa\" />\n                    <h2>Design Iterations</h2>\n                    <img className=\"big-img-designitr\" src={iteration1} alt=\"Design Iteration 1\" />\n                    <p>Our prototype implements a combination of the Recruiter and Attendee Workflows. We selected the functionality of creating groups of attendees within events and interacting with those groups, but allowed all attendees the ability to do that. In addition, we added functionality to select certain events that you will be attending. Initially, we aimed to drive in-person interaction from our application. Creating groups and interacting with groups makes contacting recruits easy for recruiters, but also facilitates large-scale interaction for all attendees. Therefore, we decided to expand that functionality from just recruiters to all attendees. </p>\n                    <h3>Alternate View Groups Designs</h3>\n                    <div className=\"alt-div\">\n                        <img className=\"alt\" src={groups} alt=\"Design Iteration 1\" />\n                        <img className=\"alt\" src={GroupsAlt} alt=\"Design Iteration 1\" />\n                    </div>\n                    <p>We created an alternate version of the screen in which users can see the groups created within an event. The alternate version takes a more graphic approach and organizes information in tiles rather than rows. The large images allow for quick and easy identification of groups and adds color to the page, making it more aesthetic. However, users may find it unintuitive because the layout varies from LinkedIn’s traditional row organization, which users will recognize from their list of connections for example. From future testing, we hope to understand whether users understand tile layouts not present in the original app. In addition, we hope to establish whether they value visual cues over verbal descriptions and whether the graphic layout detracts from the LinkedIn app’s “professional” ambience.</p>\n                    <h3>Alternate Events List Designs</h3>\n                    <div className=\"alt-div\">\n                        <img className=\"alt\" src={events} alt=\"Design Iteration 1\" />\n                        <img className=\"alt\" src={altevents} alt=\"Design Iteration 1\" />\n                    </div>\n                    <p>We also created an alternate version of the screen showing events. In this version, we take a more graphical approach and include a large picture for the event, but users must scroll through events one-by-one. It will take users longer to scroll through screens, and we plan to test whether the speed frustrates users. The success of this version also depends on whether the event creators upload quality pictures. If users recognize events from the image, events may have better recognition on news feeds. </p>\n                    <h2>Design Testing</h2>\n                    \n                    <p>We interviewed the following three people.</p>\n                    <p><b>Caroline Sih</b> - previous software engineering intern at Intuit; has attended multiple professional conferences in the past</p>\n                    <p><b>Chris Maytom</b> - chapter technology chair Tau Beta Pi, a national engineering organization; has attended conferences for Tau Beta Pi</p>\n                    <p><b>Miranda Go</b> - 2x software engineering intern at Google; attends four conferences per year</p>\n                    <p>Caroline, Chris, and Miranda all praised the aesthetic and colorful design of our feature. With the buttons and icons that we designed, they felt as though they were using the real LinkedIn app. Furthermore, they easily interacted with the group (setting filters and messaging group members). All three liked the tile layout of both alternate screens better, and found it more eye-catching and simple to use.</p>\n                    <p>Caroline, Chris, and Miranda all stated that the navigation was confusing. Specifically, they found the flow for adding attendees to a group unintuitive. They weren’t sure how to select people for a group and how the message icon helped to add people to a group. Additionally, the congratulatory message prevented them from seeing the group that they just created; they were expecting to see the new group immediately after creating it.</p>\n                    <p>We found feedback about navigation being difficult particularly meaningful. Further questions revealed the navigation was difficult for two reasons. First, the user wasn’t being led to the screens they were expecting to be led to after certain actions. For example, after creating the group, they were expecting to see the group. Second, they couldn’t find icons that they needed. They searched for obvious icons to create the new group view the new group. While the other feedback was useful, many problems stemmed from difficulty navigating the feature. For this reason, we decided to focus on the screens that facilitate the two main experiences. The first was the screen to initialize the group. The second was the screen transitioning from creating the group to the new group. Our TAs expressed similar thoughts, and stated that they did not fully grasp how the screens fit together. This was another reason that we decided to update the two screens that transition between fundamental states of our feature: attendees and groups.</p>\n                    <img className=\"xbig-img\" src={beforeafter} alt=\"final designs\" />\n                    <h2>Final Design</h2>\n                    <img className=\"xbig-img\" src={finaldesigns} alt=\"final designs\" />\n                    <h2>Reflection</h2>\n\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            \n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport default Case1;","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { Route, Link, BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport About from './Components/About';\nimport Work from './Components/Work';\nimport Projects from './Components/Projects';\nimport Design from './Components/Design';\nimport Books from './Components/Books';\nimport Resume from './Components/Resume';\nimport Case1 from './Components/Case1';\n// import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';\nimport { Redirect } from 'react-router';\n\nconst routing = (\n    <Router>\n      <div>\n        <Route exact path=\"/rdf004.github.io\" render={() => <Redirect to=\"/\" />} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={About} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/work\" component={Work} />\n        <Route path=\"/projects\" component={Projects} />\n        <Route path=\"/design\" component={Design} />\n        <Route path=\"/books\" component={Books} />\n        <Route path=\"/resume\" component={Resume} />\n        <Route path=\"/case1\" component={Case1} />\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n)\n\nReactDOM.render(routing, document.getElementById('root'));\n\n// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change\n// unregister() to register() below.
