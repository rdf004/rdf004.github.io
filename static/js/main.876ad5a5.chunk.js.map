I wanted to help build out their music instrument program, but needed credibility to fundraise. So, I went to the library and found a Nolo’s do-it-yourself law book on how to start nonprofits. I started a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Jazz Helping Hands and was able to kickstart a great piano program at the Boys & Girls Club. We also started a music program at an orphanage in Tanzania, Africa.<br/><br/>\n                From Jazz Helping Hands, I fell in love with business, product strategy, and executing visions with extremely limited resources.<br/><br/>\n                When I came to college, I found a great group of friends (Ian, Cyrus, and Surya) during Week 0 and we competed in hackathons together. We placed at SD Hacks and SB Hacks and won at Design 4 San Diego and HackTech, Caltech’s premier hackathon.<br/><br/>\n                After my freshman year, I interned at Goldman Sachs. Besides some finance work, I built a few enterprise applications for my team. One automated updating our client list by integrating with existing applications, and another used a Bayesian Classifier to automatically assign clients and investment reports to the best-fit member on our team. Together, they save the team about 35 hours per month.<br/><br/>\n                I loved Goldman, but I missed the product strategy and analysis from running Jazz Helping Hands, so I sought more product  positions. So, this past summer, I interned as a PM at Microsoft on the Azure enterprise security team, where I helped launch a new policy-driven remote attestation service for Microsoft SQL Server and helped design a new service for Windows developers to port legacy Win32 applications onto a sandbox, so compromised apps can’t access the whole OS. I received an offer from PlayFab (acq. by Microsoft in Jan. 2018) and will likely go back. I'm pretty sure James Gwertzman will be my skip manager, so pretty sweet gig.<br/><br/>\n                Now, I’m looking for product roles and software engineering roles at startups.

Hence, I created an app and an IoT device that essentially uses a collection of weak networks as as single strong network. People in a community can vote for movies/videos they want to see, and the top-voted videos will be split and a single segment will be downloaded onto each of their IoT devices. The video is then combined locally (not using the Internet) so that each person has a copy of the video. BitFlix is on GitHub <a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://github.com/rdf004/Bitflix\">here</a>.<br/><br/>\n\n                    <b>(2018) Ark</b> - At HackTech 2018, my team created an AI chatbot to help students read research papers. As students read a research paper, if they had a question about the paper or about the topic, they could ask Ark, our chatbot. Ark used AllenAI to parse the research paper and Wikipedia for answers to their question. Ark won at HackTech 2018, and you can see it <a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://devpost.com/software/ark-s8t51q\">here</a>. It's also on GitHub <a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://github.com/IanCarrasco/ark\">here</a>.<br/><br/>\n\n                    <b>(2018) SentAI</b> - At SB Hacks 2018, my team created a web app that generated movie ratings. We scraped Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter for posts and tweets about movies and used sentiment analysis and natural language processing to generate five-star ratings as well as categorize the most positive and negative reviews, all on a beautiful ReactJS frontend. SentAI received honorable mentions at SB Hacks. SentAI is on GitHub \n                    &nbsp;<a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://github.com/IanCarrasco/SentAI\">here</a>. Fun fact: we capitalized AI because Sentai reminded us too much of “Hentai.<br/><br/>\n\n                    <b>(2017) Navier</b> - At the D4SD hackathon, we designed and implemented a lane-based navigation system for autonomous vehicles. Our system/implementation created a flow of cars towards exits, and would reduce lane changes, accidents, and traffic. <a className=\"p-a\" href=\"https://scalesdblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/designing-the-future-of-transportation-in-san-diego/\">Naiver won at D4SD</a> and we were awarded $2000 (split amongst Ian and myself) and 3 months in the ScaleSD smart city accelerator. Fun Fact: Ian and I won this before our first day of college; we were the youngest team there.<br/><br/>\n\n                    <b>(2017) Using Machine Learning Techniques to Predict the Stock Market</b> - At the end of high school, I led an independent research project under the mentorship of a local professor. I used machine learning techniques to predict whether the stock prices of big-box companies would increase or decrease over a variety of time series. It was an amateur project, but was published in a journal for outstanding high school research. It also served as an introduction to CS and finance, which would lead me to Goldman Sachs and Microsoft.
